# spotprice

An interactive data visualisation of NZ electricity spot prices

This provides some cool interactive tools to understand NZ electricity prices - particularly useful for Flick 
customers. For now, it's the average price by time of day, by date and by day of the week over the last year. Users can select their preferred grid exit point for exact local pricing.

Scripts are included that fetch monthly CSVs of prices from the EMI website and import them into the PostgreSQL database.
